                <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
                <p class="text">A mitochondrion is an organelle found in the cells of most eukaryotes, such as animals,
                    plants and fungi. Mitochondria have a double membrane structure and use aerobic respiration to
                    generate
                    adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used throughout the cell as a source of chemical energy. They
                    were discovered by Albert von Kölliker in 1857 in the voluntary muscles of insects. The term
                    mitochondrion was coined by Carl Benda in 1898. The mitochondrion is popularly nicknamed the
                    "powerhouse
                    of the cell", a phrase coined by Philip Siekevitz in a 1957 article of the same name.
                    Some cells in some multicellular organisms lack mitochondria (for example, mature mammalian red
                    blood
                    cells). A large number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids and
                    diplomonads,
                    have reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures.One eukaryote,
                    Monocercomonoides,
                    is known to have completely lost its mitochondria, and one multicellular organism, Henneguya
                    salminicola, is known to have retained mitochondrion-related organelles in association with a
                    complete
                    loss of their mitochondrial genome.
                    Mitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3μm2 in cross section, but vary considerably in size and
                    structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular
                    energy,
                    mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell
                    death,
                    as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth. Mitochondrial biogenesis is in
                    turn
                    temporally coordinated with these cellular processes. Mitochondria have been implicated in several
                    human
                    disorders and conditions, such as mitochondrial diseases, cardiac dysfunction, heart failure and
                    autism.
                    The number of mitochondria in a cell can vary widely by organism, tissue, and cell type. A mature
                    red
                    blood cell has no mitochondria, whereas a liver cell can have more than 2000. The mitochondrion is
                    composed of compartments that carry out specialized functions. These compartments or regions include
                    the
                    outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, cristae, and matrix.
                    Although most of a eukaryotic cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has its
                    own
                    genome ("mitogenome") that is substantially similar to bacterial genomes. This finding has led to
                    general acceptance of the endosymbiotic hypothesis - that free-living prokaryotic ancestors of
                    modern
                    mitochondria permanently fused with eukaryotic cells in the distant past, evolving such that modern
                    animals, plants, fungi, and other eukaryotes are able to respire to generate cellular energy.

                <h2>Mitocondrial Structure</h2>
                <p class="text">Mitochondria may have a number of different shapes. A mitochondrion contains outer and
                    inner membranes composed of phospholipid bilayers and proteins. The two membranes have different
                    properties. Because of this double-membraned organization, there are five distinct parts to a
                    mitochondrion:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The outer mitochondrial membrane,</li>
                    <li>The intermembrane space (the space between the outer and inner membranes),</li>
                    <li>The inner mitochondrial membrane,</li>
                    <li>The cristae space (formed by infoldings of the inner
                        membrane), and</li>
                    <li>The matrix (space within
                        the inner membrane), which is a fluid.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Mitochondria have folding to increase surface area, which in turn increases ATP (adenosine
                    triphosphate) production. Mitochondria stripped of their outer membrane are called mitoplasts.

                <h2>PET for Diagnosis of Mytochondrial Cardiomyopathy in Children</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    Purpose: To study the capability of positron emission tomography for mitochondrial dysfunction
                    diagnosis on basis of oxidative metabolism evaluation.Methods: PET studies were carried out in 13
                    patients (pts.) aged from 2 to 13 years (7,5+3,1) with CMP: hypertopic (HCMP) - 4, dilated (DCMP) -
                    9.The dynamic study with [C-11]-acetate was performed for evaluation of Krebs cycle activity. Rate
                    constant (k(mono)) and [C-11]-activity clearance half-time (t(1/2)) were calculated using myocardial
                    time-activity curve (from 3 to 10 min.). Myocardial perfusion was assessed with [N-13]-ammonia,
                    glucose metabolism - with [F-18]-fluorodeoxylucose (FDG).Results: Perfusion was normal in hypertohic
                    parts of left ventricle (LV) in patients with HCMP. Krebs cycle activity was reduced (k(mono) =
                    0,077 +/- 0,013 min(-1)). Glucose utilisation was increased in comparison with norm. Thus, Krebs
                    cycle activity reduction (mitochondrial dysfunction) was compensated by increasing glycolysis
                    activity. Perfusion was normal in all children with DCMP. Krebs cycle activity was reduced in LV in
                    6 pts. (k(mono) = 0,065 +/- 0,029 min(-1)), normal - in 3 (k(mono) = 0,104 +/- 0,010 min(-1)). All
                    children had normal oxidative metabolism in right ventricle (k(mono) = 0,129 +/- 0,203
                    min(-1)).Focal perfusion defects were noted in 2 pts. with CMP. In this region the Krebs cycle
                    activity was decreased more then another LV parts. It means that ischemic injuries were. Glucose
                    utilisation reduction in this field means that injuries were irreversible.Conclusion: PET study
                    showed Krebs cycle activity reduction in children with cardiomyopathy was noted despite in normal
                    perfusion (mitochondrial dysfunction) vs. ischemic injuries of myocardium.

                <h2>Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases </h2>
                <p class="text">
                    Many lines of evidence suggest that mitochondria have a central role in ageing-related
                    neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria are critical regulators of cell death, a key feature of
                    neurodegeneration. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA and oxidative stress both contribute to ageing,
                    which is the greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. In all major examples of these
                    diseases there is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs early and acts causally in
                    disease pathogenesis. Moreover, an impressive number of disease-specific proteins interact with
                    mitochondria. Thus, therapies targeting basic mitochondrial processes, such as energy metabolism or
                    free-radical generation, or specific interactions of disease-related proteins with mitochondria,
                    hold great promise.
